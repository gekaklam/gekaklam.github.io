I've decided to start blogging using Jekyll and have my "blog" hosted on
GitHub, using GitHub pages. This is basically my first post, so a
number of mistakes will be present. Hopefully I'll improve in
time. On this post I'll explain how I got here and how I'm planning to use
this platform. 

I've had a "Wordpress Personal" account since 2015. As a sucker I was
convinced by the [LiveYourLegend](http://liveyourlegend.net/) website
/ programm, that I
needed to have a proffessional subscription on Wordpress to get my
blogging seriously. Yeah... that didn't work for me. So after two
years of paid subscription... I had zero posts. That's right. I
hadn't published anything. 

Don't get me wrong. It wasn't that I didn't want to publish
something. It was just that there was never enought time, or I never
had a topic that I though it was really cool (I was going through some
issues at the time). Another issue was the writting process and the
whole interface.

I'm a really big fun of the Emacs editor, and I'd love to be able to write
a post from here (since I'm using Emacs to write these
lines). Especially using [Org-Mode](http://orgmode.org/) -- which slowly but steadily is taking over my life. Of course there
are plugins for Emacs to integrate it with Wordpress, but still it
wasn't the same. It was just increasing the complexity. Then, there
was the issue of version controll. Of course I could have a local git
repo where all my (plaintext) posts would be stored, but this wouldn't
be integrated with the online platform. So I was searching for a way
to write posts in plain text while keeping them under version
controll. Also being able to customize all the aspects of my site, was something
that I always wanted. And using a fixed platform, such as Wordpress,
didn't offer that much flexibility. 

By chance I found out that you can get your own "website" from GitHub,
using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the system that
stands behind them ([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)) can also be used
to create blogs. So I've decided to give it a try. So far I'm just
playing around the documentation pages -- and this blog is result of
that -- but hopefully I'll improve in the future.
