Hi! I'm George. A physicist turned Linux Systems Administrator, turned Computer Scientist. 

This is a personal experiment to see if I can keep up with writting. Originally I'm from Greece, but currently I'm in Germany doing a masters in applied computer science and working as a research assistant in a computing center.
